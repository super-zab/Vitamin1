A QA engineer walks into a bar.

He orders a beer.
He orders 0 beers.
He orders 999999999 beers.
He orders a lizard.
He orders -1 beers.
He orders a ueicbksjdhd.

All tests pass.

Then the first real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is.
The bar bursts into flames.

Why is it funny ? CS guys test every cases possible, only to watch their code crash due to a basic user interaction, lol. :p
